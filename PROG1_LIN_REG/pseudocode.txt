 - read in the X matrix and the Y vector as gsl_matrix and gsl_vector from files
 - this function needs two additional input parameters: number of observations and number of features
 - allocate space for the vector of estimated parameters
 - do the matrix operations 
        betas = inv(t(X)X)t(X)y
